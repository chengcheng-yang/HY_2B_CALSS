# HY_2B_CALSS

This repository provides guidances about data analysis of the HY_2B data for Python and Matlab codes.

## Install python env
To (locally) reproduce this project simply clone the repository 
```
git clone https://github.com/chengcheng-yang/HY_2B_CALSS.git 
```
and save it in a folder.

Then you need to create a `env` for python environment by runing

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
(Note that please don't `conda install packages` in the base env)
then you can activate the python `env` by type
```
conda activate HY_2B 
```

Now we can use the `HY_2B` env to do data analysis of HY_2B observations.
